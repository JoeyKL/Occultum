Constructed deck-building game. Each player assembles a deck which becomes the supply for the game. Players may purchase cards from their supply row, which are then added to their discard pile to be shuffled into their deck.

Card types include Followers, Incantations, Artifacts, Horrors.

Followers are added to your deck and provide gold and special abilities when you play them. 

Incantations perform an action instantaniously, then are discarded. Powerful effects.

Artifacts are added to your tablou that provide a passive or an ability that may be used every turn. Costs of using their ability includesn spending Power, Actions, and or Tapping them.

Horrors are cards with negative effects that are shuffled into your opponents deck rather than your own.

On your turn you will
1) Suffer the consequences of any horrors
2) Play any followers and rituals from your hand
3) Buy cards from the supply row (adding them to your discard pile)
5) Discard all the cards you played that turn
4) Draw until you have 5 cards, revealing and setting aside any horrors to activate at the start of your next turn

Once you have accumulated enough Omens (~20-30), your Elder One awakens, giving you an incredibly powerful ability and allowing you to win the game on some condition. The other way to win the game is to kill all of your opponentsâ€™ followers. If they cannot draw at least 1 follower when drawing their hand, they lose the game.

You by default draw 5 cards and have 2 actions. An action is either playing a follower from your hand or buying a card.

Some effects (costs for incantations, horrors, etc.) will specifiy that a follower goes insane. When this happens, it is removed from your deck and replaced with a 



Random mechanic ideas:
- You have the ability to always gain 1 omen every turn, possibly by default, or by sacrificing a follower (which may actually be a good thing.) This prevents slogs that go nowhere, as if both players are immobilized, someone will eventually win.
    - Relatedly, when your supply runs out, your opponnent starts getting 2 omens a turn!
    - Player to go second starts with 1 extra omen?

- Add one card to your supply row a turn. Row managment is part of the strategy of the game.

- Permanenant buffs can be added to cards, like making it have +1 Follower, +1 Action, or +1 Power every time it is played.

- After your old one is summonned, your win condition becomes to defeat the other old one by dealing damage. Each omen you would gain instead does 1 damage to your opponnent. If your damage ever overtakes your Omens, you lose!

- Omens are actually inverse? As in, more like a count down to doomsday? Start with 10 and try to get rid of them all. Doesn't necesarily make a mechanical difference except to disallow differently costed Elder Gods.
