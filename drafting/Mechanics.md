Constructed deck-building game. Each player assembles a deck which becomes the supply for the game. Players may purchase cards from their supply row or a limited portion of their opponents supply row.

Card types include Followers, Rituals and Horrors. Followers are the main part of your deck that provide gold and special abilities. Rituals earn you Omens by spending a certain amount of gold (Paying a price not nessesarily gold. Could be a sacrifice). Horrors are negative cards that are shuffled into your opponents deck rather than your own.

On your turn you will
1) suffer the consequences of any horrors
2) play any followers and rituals from your hand
3) buy any cards from the supply row (adding them to your discard pile)
4) draw until you have 5 cards, revealing and setting aside any horrors

Once you have accumulated enough Omens (~10-15), your Old One awakens, giving you an incredibly powerful ability and allowing you to win the game on some condition. The other way to win the game is to kill all of your opponentsâ€™ followers. If, when they shuffle their deck, they have no followers, their cult has been destroyed.
